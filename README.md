Scripts for the manuscript: [AI-powered holistic and dynamic plant-pathology to deliver new sources of resistance]

Welcome to the repository for the scripts used in our manuscript, ”[AI-powered holistic and dynamic plant-pathology to deliver new sources of resistance]”. This repository contains code written in Python and R for various tasks, including controlling an imaging tower, working with QR codes, deep-learning model Fast-nema for nematode capture ,statistical modeling using the BLUES model, and data visualisation.

Project Description

This repository includes the scripts developed for my our manuscript, focusing on the 3D printed and Deep-learning powered high-throughput phenotyping platform to automatic capture the nematode-centric phenotype capture. The scripts were used for:

	•	Controlling a custom-built imaging tower.
	•	Reading, storing, and generating QR codes.
 	•	The deep-learning model Fast-nema for recognising nematode phenotypes: including number, size, shape, colour.
	•	Implementing the BLUES model for pairwise comparisons.
	•	Creating publication-quality visualisations.

These scripts were developed in collaboration with my supervisor and colleagues.

Scripts Overview

Python Scripts

	1.	Imaging Tower Control:
	•	Scripts for controlling the hardware and capturing images.
	2.	QR Code Handling:
	•	Generating QR codes for labeling samples.
	•	Reading and storing information from QR codes.

R Scripts

	1.	Statistical Modeling:
	•	Implementation of the BLUES model for pairwise comparisons.
	2.	Visualisation:
	•	Scripts for plotting data and creating publication-ready figures.
