Scripts for PhD Thesis: [AI-powered holistic and dynamic plant-pathology to deliver new sources of resistance]

Welcome to the repository for the scripts used in my PhD thesis, ”[AI-powered holistic and dynamic plant-pathology to deliver new sources of resistance]”. This repository contains code written in Python and R for various tasks, including controlling an imaging tower, working with QR codes, statistical modeling using the BLUES model, and data visualization.

Project Description

This repository includes the scripts developed for my PhD research, focusing on [brief description of your thesis, e.g., automated imaging, data analysis, and statistical modeling]. The scripts were used for:

	•	Controlling a custom-built imaging tower.
	•	Reading, storing, and generating QR codes.
	•	Implementing the BLUES model for pairwise comparisons.
	•	Creating publication-quality visualizations.

These scripts were developed in collaboration with my supervisor and colleagues.

Scripts Overview

Python Scripts

	1.	Imaging Tower Control:
	•	Scripts for controlling the hardware and capturing images.
	2.	QR Code Handling:
	•	Generating QR codes for labeling samples.
	•	Reading and storing information from QR codes.

R Scripts

	1.	Statistical Modeling:
	•	Implementation of the BLUES model for pairwise comparisons.
	2.	Visualization:
	•	Scripts for plotting data and creating publication-ready figures.

Dependencies

Make sure you have the following software and libraries installed:

Python

	•	numpy
	•	opencv-python
	•	qrcode
	•	pandas
	•	Other dependencies (list specific libraries used in your scripts).

R

	•	ggplot2
	•	lme4 (if used for BLUES model)
	•	Other required packages.

How to Use

	1.	Clone the repository:
 git clone https://github.com/Carinawei97/MAGIC-screen-to-cyst-namtatodes.git
 cd MAGIC-screen-to-cyst-namtatodes

 	2.	Explore the Python and R directories to access the scripts:
	•	Python scripts for imaging tower control and QR code handling.
	•	R scripts for modeling and plotting.
